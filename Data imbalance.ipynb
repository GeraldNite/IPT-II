    "   is recognized as one of the major problem in `machine learning`, as most machine learning algorithms assume that data is equally distributed. This cause machine learning classfiers to be **baised** to majority classes. This cause poor classification of the minority class and sometimes classfiers predict all data set as **majority classes**"
